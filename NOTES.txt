TASK - 11 - Student Data Synchronization System- WORKING WITH DOUBLE DATABASES

DATABASE NAME - DB1 : student_db1 
DATABASE NAME - DB2 : student_db2

This project is designed to manage and synchronize student records between two MySQL databases (Database1 and Database2) using Node.js. It includes the following functionalities:

Student Registration: Allows new student records to be added to Database1.
Compare and Sync: Compares student data in Database1 and Database2 for a given aadhar_number. If discrepancies are found, it updates Database2 to match Database1.
Insert Missing Records: Automatically inserts the student record into Database2 if it doesnâ€™t exist.
Field Comparison: Ensures only mismatched fields are updated, optimizing performance.
RESTful API: Provides endpoints for registration (/register) and synchronization (/compare-sync-student).
